# What is the Wordle Project?
The Wordle Project is based on the well-known word guessing game, Wordle. The original game
was created by a Welsh software engineer, Josh Wardle. The game works by allowing players
a limited amount of guesses, usually six guesses. Players win the game by guessing the word
correctly before they run out of guesses. They lose when they don't guess the word within the
number of guesses they are given. The game also provides hints that help players towards
guessing the correct word.
