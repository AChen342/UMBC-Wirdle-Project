# Wordle Project
#### First project written in the Computer Science I course (CMSC201) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). 
#### This project was written using C++ Andrew Chen and was submitted on March 1st.
# What is the Wordle Project?
#### The Wordle Project models the well known word guessing game, Wordle, created by Josh Wardle.
#### This version Wordle works by the user having five tries at guessing the word correctly. The winning
#### condition results in the user having guessed the word before they run out of tries. The losing
#### condition, on the other hand, occurs when the user does not guess the word by the fifth try. The game also 
#### provides hints that give the user an idea of how close they are to guessing the game. While the original game 
#### used colors for hints, this version will use the characters, '_', '!', and '&'.
